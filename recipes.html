				<h2>Try These Baking Recipes!</h2>
				<p> Now that we have our ingredients collecting, our tools at our ready, and a little understanding of the science behind baking, let’s have a hand at some recipes!
				<p>Here we have our basic pie dough recipe. The sizing might alarm you here, but we’ve given you a larger batch for a reason. For one, it might be easier to see what is happening in the mix as it coming together if there is more of it. So, hopefully this larger batch size can help you understand the process as it is happening. Secondly, this batch size is large enough for two double-crust pies or four single-crust pies if that is more to your liking. This may sound like a lot, I know, but we highly recommend freezing this dough. The dough freezes extremely well and makes having a pie at any time of year that much easier!

			<p>1. Cut butter into half-inch chunks and place into fridge. You want that butter to stay as cold as possible.
			<p>2. Measure out water and and ice - keep it in the fridge or even freezer! 
			<p>3. Combine the salt with the flour in the bowl you plan to be using for mixing.
			<p>4. When you have ensured the butter and water are just about as cold as they can get, start mixing the butter in with the flour/salt. Really though, we call this step 'cutting-in the butter'. This is because we are not so much trying to hydrate the flour with the butter, but instead cut the butter into smaller chunks that will be more workable for the pie dough. When finished cutting in the butter, the butter should be no larger than the size of a marble and no smaller than a pea.
			<p>5. When butter is incorporated and cut, slowly drizzle in your ice water. Take it slow. Chances are you won't need all of that water so just do a little bit at a time until you notice the dough is becoming well hydrated. The dough should not be wet, but you should not be able to see any loose grains of flour. Once the flour is hydrated, only give the dough a mix or two to bring some bigger chunks of dough together.
			<p>6. Divide the dough into four equal pieces, wrap well with plastic wrap and toss them in the freezer. That's it! Pie for another day!
