				<h2>What Roles Do Ingredients Play?</h2>
				<p>So you've just splurged at the store on all of these wonderful looking products - eager to turn out something really nice for you and your people, but &#40besides tasting great and bringing some nutrition to the table&#41 what the heck do these ingredients do, anyways? Let's take a moment to break it all down in the very first step of the baking process: knowing the ingredients and the roles they play.
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Wheat Flour</h3>
				<p>Flour is, more often than not, your main structure builder. Offering both starch and <a href="./gluten.html">gluten</a>, flour is the main structure behind your cakes and breads. Flour is what gives your bread shape, your cake body, and your pie dough substance.
				<p>The starches and proteins found within the flour are great at absorbing liquid. The high absorption rate found in the main structure builder of your product will translate, if all goes according to plan, a moist baked good.
				<p>In addition, flour can also contributes to the sugar content of a product. Though there isn't much sugar, these sugars are vital in the contribution of the final products color and in the fermentation of bread dough.
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Leaveners</h3>
				<p>While structure builders like flour give baked products’ their body, leaveners give them their rise – and in some cases, additional flavor.
				<h4>What Is Baking Soda?</h4>
				<p>When dealing with cakes and quickbreads, oftentimes you will be reaching for baking soda and baking powder for your leavener. Baking soda, aka sodium bicarbonate, is an alkaline compound that, when introduced to an acid, produces carbon dioxide gas. Timed properly with the starch gelatinization that happens during baking, the carbon dioxide gas produced will result in a risen, lighter end result.
				<h4>What Is Baking Powder?</h4>
				<p>Baking powder is packaged combination of baking soda and an acid. Cream of tartar, a crystalline byproduct from the fermentation process of wine, is commonly used as the acid portion in baking powder. Because baking powder contains an acid, it is used to leaven those recipes that are low on additional acids such as lemon juice, brown sugar, or buttermilk. 
				<h4>What Is Yeast?</h4>
				<p>Yeast is your go to leavener for breads. Yeast is a unicellular fungus that is used to both ferment and raise your bread doughs. Yeast has the wonderful power of converting those sugars in your dough and turning them into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide can help produce a lighter, risen product, much like baking soda/baking powder can. Yeast, for artisan bread bakers, is highly regarded for its ability to ferment. Yeast fermentation is the main source of flavor behind the mild, sweet ciabatta and a robust sourdough.
				<h4>Water Is A Leavener?</h4>
				<p>Yes, yes it is. As the temperature rises in the oven, water converts into steam and expands – pushing out the walls of <a href="./gluten.html">gluten</a> formed in your bread dough, and helping you achieve that sought-after open crumb and impressive oven-spring.
