				<h2>About The Baker:</h2>
				<p>We, at The Home Baker's Digest are admittedly, a team of one. I really just like to speak about myself as a we because it makes me feel more supported. We could all probably use a little more support in our lives. That, in it's essence, is why I'm here.
				<p>I am a professional baker by trade. Having studied Baking in Pastry in school and working in several bakeshops and restaurants over the last ten years, I have become an advocate for the home baker and cook. Too much we tend to buy seems to come processed. It is time we take control of our diets, our creativity, and our fundamental &#40and sometimes forgotten&#41 desire to learn and improve ourselves. A great way to hit all those marks is by good, old-fashioned, home cooking.
				<p>Baking, though loved by just about all, can also prove to be the most challenge for a novice. There is a definite science, a rhyme to the reason, that if not understood can just have an air of black magic trickery. The Home Baker's Digest is here to dispell that notion and put the power in your hands. You can create a gorgeous loaf of bread, a beautfully most cake, and a deeply satisfying flaky pie - you might just not know it yet.
				<p>With guidance from The Home Baker's Digest, we hope to give you all that you need to feel comfortable and confident baking in your own home kitchen.
