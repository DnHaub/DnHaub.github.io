				<h2>What Happens During Mixing?</h2>
				<p>The first two things that happen when mixing come as no surprise to any home baker. As soon as you start turning that spoon or get that mixer whirling you are both distributing your ingredients evenly throughout the mix and hydrating those ingredients. Your liquid will begin to absorb into all of those starches, gums, and proteins present in your mix.
				<p>Hydration is critical element to produce your desired product. With hydration, we are able to develop <a href="./gluten.html">gluten</a>, activate our leaveners, and dissolve both our sugars and our salts.  Without a properly developed gluten or activated leaveners, we will be left with a product that is dense and flat. Without our dissolved sugars, our product may lack structure and/or a tender and moist crumb. Without dissolved salt, our finished baked good will not be properly seasoned and our dough will not be properly fermented.
				<p>In addition to all of the work that goes into hydrating and developing the mixed product, mixing also plays an incredible role that is underappreciated. When mixing, you will actually be creating very small air cells within the batter or dough. It is within these air cells that are created in the mixing process, that our leaveners give rise. Though you may think that the leaveners introduced to the mix create their own magic, in reality, they are just adding to the magic already inherent in the mix.
