				<h2>What Tools Do I Need To Bake At Home?</h2>
				I suppose the best answer to that question is - it depends. It depends on the products you hope to make. After all, a bundt cake is just a cake without a bundt pan! Perhaps more importantly, it depends on your budget. There is no need to spend an exorbitant amount of your hard-earned money on equipment, in reality, you might use just a couple of times a year. While a standing mixer is a wonderful tool, you can still make a nice loaf of bread with nothing more than a bowl and a pair of hands. 
				Though, of course, tools will help make your job easier and the easier the job, the more likely you might be to bake more often. So, let’s introduce some of the equipment you might find useful and break them down!  
				
				<p><span class="bold">Mixing Bowl</span>
					<p>In addition to any mixing bowls you may have for a standing mixer, you should have at least one good-sized mixing bowl. Preferably you have a set of three in varying sizes, but one larger, fairly wide mixing bowl should do just fine. 
				
				<p><span class="bold">Spatula</span>
					<p>If you had to get one, get a large, sturdy spatula that can withstand some heat. You might have to do some mixing with it, and it might have to take a dip or two into liquid-hot chocolate – so make sure it’s up to the task. A second spatula that has a little more flex might come in handy too. You’ll want that flexible blade so you can use the spatula to scrape out all the last bits of batter, because any bit left behind is just less cake. Nobody wants <span class=”em”>less</span> cake!
				
				<p><span class="bold">Wooden Spoon</span>
					<p>Sometimes that sturdy spatula just isn’t strong enough to stand up to the mixing ahead of you. If you need something with a little more strength to it – the wooden spoon is the perfect tool.
				
				<p><span class="bold">Plastic Scraper</span>
					<p>Okay, so not technically essential, but I love these little buggers. These white blades fit in your hand perfectly, are dirt cheap, and a great multipurpose tool. With these you can scrape your mixing bowl to ensure an even mix, decant your product into whatever vessel it is destined for, and clean up your mess!
				
				<p><span class="bold">Sheet Pan</span>
					<p>Stay away from the cookie pans you see at the grocery store. Instead, invest in sheet pans you would find in any professional kitchen. Get the ‘half sheet pan.’ They are 18” by 13” and have a lip deep enough to suit focaccia, sheet cakes, and roasted vegies! The ‘half’ size also fits the majority of home ovens.
				
				<p><span class="bold">Parchment/Silpat</span>
					<p>You’ll want to make sure to line your half sheet pan with some parchment paper before you plop your cookie dough down – otherwise you might have a heck of a time getting the cookies on a cooling rack. Alternatively, if you’d like, you could purchase a Silpat. These are silicon baking mats that can withstand high temperatures, a large number of bakes, and provide a little insulation &#40keeping those cookies from burning on the bottom&#41. Though they are convenient and reduce waste, I have personally found the Silpat largely non-essential over parchment paper.
				
				<p><span class="bold">Kitchen Scale</span>
					<p>Though many of the recipes you can find online or in books are written out by volume, if you really want to own your craft and begin scaling recipes on your own or even tweaking/developing existing recipes, than a scale is essential. Scaling recipes have the potential of going a little haywire if you stick to the measurements by volume. If, however, you convert those measurements to weight, then the world is your croissant.
				
				<p><span class="bold">Oven</span>
					<p>Obviously. If you are concerned about the quality of your home oven, I’d recommend you buy an oven thermometer. These thermometers are made to live in your oven and are also very cheap, well worth it to ensure you are at the right temperature before entrusting a failing oven with all of your hard work and expensive ingredients.
