				<h2>Welcome!</h2>
				<p> The kitchen can be an intimidating place to the unfamiliar. The kitchen itself has tools or equipment that can at best bewilder and at worst slice a thumb clean off. Your recipe book can read like another language and consistently produce construction-grade bricks. It's heavy enough to turn you off of baking forever. 
				<p><span class="em">Don't worry, mistakes will happen.</span>
				<p>The only way to improve and become the master of your kitchen is through a little practice and a little know-how. This is why we are here. The Master Baker is here to provide you, the home baker, with a basic understanding of some of the science behind the scenes, tips for success, and plenty of opportunities to practice your craft and see the science in action. We are here to empower, embolden, and satisfy all you do-it-yourself, carbohydrate enthusiasts. So please, flour up and rest assured - the proof will be in the pudding.
