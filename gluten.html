				<h2>What Is Gluten, Really?</h2>
				Wheat flour contains, among others, two main proteins of which the home baker should be aware - glutenin and gliadin. Under a microscope, the glutenin and gliadin proteins found in dry flour look something like individual strands curled up on themselves. In this dry form, the flour has not developed any gluten. However, once a liquid is introduced, glutenin and gliadin readily absorb that moisture, swell, and begin to unravel. This unravelling of the two proteins continue as the product is mixed, ultimately distributing and connecting all of these unraveled proteins into something we know as 'gluten'. Without gluten, bread would lack shape and fail to capture all of that air that develops during proofing and baking. All of those beautiful holes you see in your baguette &#40what we in the biz call an 'open crumb'&#41, would not be possible without gluten. 
				<p>For an optimal rise and enjoyable chew, many breads are mixed to the peak of their gluten development. To check the gluten development of a bread dough, employ the windowpane test.
				<p>To "check the window" of your dough, quickly snag a decent chunk of dough from your mixing bowl. A bit of dough roughly the size of a golf ball shall do. Then quickly &#40and carefully&#41 teasing/stretching the dough with both hand extend the dough outwards. If the gluten is fully developed, your gluten window should be smooth, thin, and fairly transparent. Think of the appearance of a stretched balloon. The more underdeveloped the dough, the more shaggy and readily torn the dough will be.
				<p>Keep in mind, even though a fully developed gluten structure may produce the best results in certain kinds of bread, a developed gluten structure could be the end of certain baked goods - cakes, quickbreads, pie doughs, etc. In these doughs/batters you want to do your best to inhibit gluten development or you may end up with a tough, unappetizing product.
